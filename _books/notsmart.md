Whether you’re deciding which smartphone to purchase or which politician to believe,
you think you are a rational being whose every decision is based on cool, detached logic.
But here’s the truth: You are not so smart. You’re just as deluded as the rest of us—but that’s okay, because being deluded is part of being human. 
</p><p>
Growing out of David McRaney’s popular blog, You Are Not So Smart reveals that every decision we make, every thought we contemplate,
and every emotion we feel comes with a story we tell ourselves to explain them. But often these stories aren’t true.
Each short chapter—covering topics such as Learned Helplessness, Selling Out, and the Illusion of Transparency—is like a psychology course with all the boring parts taken out.

Bringing together popular science and psychology with humor and wit, You Are Not So Smart is a celebration of our irrational, thoroughly human behavior.
