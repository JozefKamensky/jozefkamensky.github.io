 In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning 
 the earthâ€™s surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, 
 and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, 
 and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside.
  Artyom was born in the last days before the fire. Having never ventured beyond his Metro Station-City limits, one fateful 
  event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat.
   His journey takes him from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, 
   where his actions will determine the fate of mankind.
